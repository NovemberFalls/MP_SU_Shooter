## Overview
In this lecture, we test our multiplayer plugin by:
1. Packaging and distributing the game
2. Testing connections between two machines over Steam
3. Implementing proper character movement using the Third Person Template

---

## Package Distribution Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Package Game] -->|Zip Windows Folder| B[Upload to Drive]
    B -->|Download on Second Machine| C[Test on Both Machines]
    C -->|Verify Connection| D[Test Multiplayer]
```

### Steps for Distribution:
1. Navigate to project build folder
2. Locate Windows folder containing executable
3. Compress Windows folder to ZIP
4. Upload to file sharing service (e.g., Google Drive)
5. Download and extract on second machine

---

## Initial Connection Testing

### Test Environment Setup:
- Two separate machines
- Different Steam accounts on each machine
- Steam running on both systems

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'dark', 'themeVariables': {'actorTextColor': '#ffffff', 'actorBorder': '#ffffff'}}}%%
sequenceDiagram
    participant Host as Machine 1 (Host)
    participant Steam as Steam Network
    participant Client as Machine 2 (Client)
    
    Host->>Steam: Launch Game & Host Session
    Host->>Host: Travel to Lobby Level
    Client->>Steam: Launch Game & Join Session
    Steam-->>Client: Connect to Host
    Client->>Host: Join Lobby Level
```

### Initial Limitations:
- Default pawn movement only
- Limited replication
- No graceful exit implementation

---

## Character Movement Implementation

### Adding Third Person Template:
1. Content Browser → Add → Add Feature or Content Pack
2. Select "Third Person Template Material"
3. Import into project

### Configuring Lobby Level:
1. Open Lobby map
2. Set Game Mode Override to ThirdPersonGameMode
3. Verify default pawn class is ThirdPersonCharacter

```mermaid

    A[Lobby Level] -->|Override| B[ThirdPersonGameMode]
    B -->|Default Pawn| C[ThirdPersonCharacter]
    C -->|Features| D[Replicated Movement]
```

### Benefits:
- Pre-configured character movement
- Automatic movement replication
- Visual representation of other players

---

## Final Testing Process

1. Delete existing builds
2. Package updated project
3. Create new ZIP file
4. Upload and distribute
5. Test on both machines:
   - Host on one machine
   - Join from second machine
   - Verify character visibility
   - Confirm movement replication

### Success Criteria:
- Both players visible in game
- Movement replication working
- Successful connection across internet
- Steam session properly established

---

## Key Takeaways
- Successfully implemented cross-internet multiplayer
- Added visual character representation
- Verified movement replication
- Established foundation for future development
