# Creating and Organizing Character Classes in Unreal Engine

---

## Introduction

When developing a game, proper organization of your code and assets is crucial for maintaining a clean, scalable project. Let's walk through the process of creating a character class while establishing a solid organizational structure that will serve us well as our project grows.

---

## Understanding Project Organization

Think of your project structure like a well-organized library. Just as a library has different sections for different types of books, our project needs distinct areas for different types of code and blueprints. 

This organization becomes especially important as your project grows larger.

---

## Setting Up the C++ Character Class

### Creating the Base Class

First, we'll create our character class in C++. This gives us the foundation upon which we'll build our game-specific functionality. 

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Right-click in the C++ Classes folder
2. Select "New C++ Class"
3. Choose "Character" as the parent class
4. Name it "BlasterCharacter"
5. Create it in a "Character" subfolder

---

### Understanding the Folder Structure

```
Source/
└── Blaster/
    ├── Character/
    │   ├── BlasterCharacter.h
    │   └── BlasterCharacter.cpp
    └── Other Game Files
```

When creating classes in subfolders, you might encounter a common include error. Here's how to fix it:

In BlasterCharacter.cpp, change:
```cpp
// From this:
#include "Character/BlasterCharacter.h"

// To this:
#include "BlasterCharacter.h"
```

This works because the compiler already knows we're in the Character folder, so we don't need to specify it in the include path.

---

## Creating the Blueprint Character

After setting up our C++ class, we'll create a Blueprint version that inherits from it. This gives us the flexibility to make quick adjustments in the editor while maintaining our core functionality in C++.

---

### Blueprint Organization

Create this folder structure in your Content folder:

```
Content/
└── Blueprints/
    └── Character/
        └── BP_BlasterCharacter
```

The "BP_" prefix helps us quickly identify Blueprint assets, distinguishing them from their C++ counterparts.

---

### Setting Up the Character Mesh

When configuring the character mesh, we need to pay attention to positioning and rotation. 

Here are the key steps:

1. Select the mesh component
2. Choose the character skeletal mesh
3. Adjust the rotation (90 degrees around Z-axis to face X direction)
4. Adjust the Z position (-88 units to align with capsule)

These numbers aren't arbitrary:

- The 90-degree rotation aligns the character with the game's forward direction
- The -88 Z-position matches the capsule's half-height, ensuring the character's feet touch the ground

---

### Position Calculations Explained

The character's position is calculated like this:
```
Character Base Position = Capsule Center Position - Capsule Half Height
-88 = 0 - 88
```

This places the character's feet exactly at ground level, which is crucial for proper movement and collision detection.

---

## Best Practices and Tips

### 1. Consistent Naming Conventions

- C++ Classes: Base name (e.g., "BlasterCharacter")
- Blueprints: BP prefix (e.g., "BP_BlasterCharacter")
- Folders: Descriptive, singular form (e.g., "Character" not "Characters")

---

### 2. Folder Organization

- Keep related files together
- Separate C++ from Blueprints
- Use clear, descriptive folder names

---

### 3. Component Setup

- Always check component positions
- Verify rotations match your game's coordinate system
- Document any magic numbers (like -88 for height) with comments

---

## Next Steps

Now that we have our basic character set up, we can move on to:

1. Adding a camera and spring arm
2. Implementing input handling
3. Programming movement functionality

Remember: Good organization at the start of your project saves countless hours of refactoring later. Take the time to set up your structure properly now, and you'll thank yourself later in development.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Include Errors After Creating Subfolders

- Symptom: Compiler can't find header files
- Solution: Adjust include paths to be relative to current folder
- Example: Remove folder name from include if you're already in that folder

---

### 2. Mesh Alignment Issues

- Symptom: Character floating or sinking into ground
- Solution: Adjust Z position based on capsule half-height
- Verification: Test character in game view to ensure proper placement

---

### 3. Blueprint Location

- Symptom: Difficulty finding assets
- Solution: Use consistent folder structure and naming conventions
- Best Practice: Keep all character-related blueprints in Blueprints/Character folder

Remember to compile and test after each major change to catch any issues early in the development process.
