# Complete Character System Setup in Unreal Engine
## Integrating Cameras and Modular Components

When developing a third-person character system, we need to think carefully about how our camera system interacts with our modular character design. The placement and behavior of our camera can significantly impact how players experience our character's customization and movement.

## Camera System Setup

Let's start with our camera system, which consists of two main components: a spring arm (CameraBoom) and the camera itself (FollowCamera).

### Component Declaration
In our header file, we declare our camera components:

```cpp
private:
    UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, Category="Camera")
    USpringArmComponent* CameraBoom;

    UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, Category="Camera")
    UCameraComponent* FollowCamera;
```

### Camera Component Implementation
In our constructor, we set up these components:

```cpp
ABlasterCharacter::ABlasterCharacter()
{
    // Create and configure the camera boom (spring arm)
    CameraBoom = CreateDefaultSubobject<USpringArmComponent>("CameraBoom");
    CameraBoom->SetupAttachment(GetMesh());  // Attaching to mesh instead of capsule
    CameraBoom->TargetArmLength = 600.0f;    // Camera distance from character
    CameraBoom->bUsePawnControlRotation = true;  // Rotate arm based on controller
    
    // Create and configure the follow camera
    FollowCamera = CreateDefaultSubobject<UCameraComponent>("FollowCamera");
    FollowCamera->SetupAttachment(CameraBoom, USpringArmComponent::SocketName);
    FollowCamera->bUsePawnControlRotation = false;  // Camera maintains relative rotation
}
```

### Important Camera Considerations

The camera system involves several key design decisions:

1. **Attachment Point**: We attach the CameraBoom to the mesh rather than the capsule component. Here's why:
   ```cpp
   CameraBoom->SetupAttachment(GetMesh());  // Rather than GetRootComponent()
   ```
   This choice prevents camera height changes when crouching, as the capsule height changes won't affect our camera position.

2. **Camera Height**: We adjust the camera boom's Z position to get a better view:
   ```cpp
   // In constructor after setup
   CameraBoom->SetRelativeLocation(FVector(0.0f, 0.0f, 88.0f));
   ```
   This positions the camera at character mid-height rather than foot level.

3. **Control Rotation**: The spring arm follows controller rotation while the camera maintains its relative position:
   ```cpp
   CameraBoom->bUsePawnControlRotation = true;   // Spring arm rotates
   FollowCamera->bUsePawnControlRotation = false; // Camera stays fixed relative to arm
   ```

## Modular Character Components

With our camera system in place, we can implement our modular character system. These components need to work harmoniously with our camera setup.

### Component Categories

We organize our character components into logical groups:

```cpp
protected:
    // Weapons and Equipment
    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category="Character|Weapon")
    TObjectPtr<USkeletalMeshComponent> Weapon_R;
    
    // Character Customization
    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category="Character|Hair")
    TObjectPtr<USkeletalMeshComponent> Hair;
    
    // Body Components
    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category="Character|Body")
    TObjectPtr<USkeletalMeshComponent> UpperBody;
```

### Component Setup Helpers

Our helper functions ensure consistent setup across all components:

```cpp
void ABlasterCharacter::SetupSkeletalMeshComponent(
    TObjectPtr<USkeletalMeshComponent>& Component, 
    const FString& Name)
{
    Component = CreateDefaultSubobject<USkeletalMeshComponent>(FName(*Name));
    if (Component)
    {
        Component->SetupAttachment(GetMesh());
        Component->SetLeaderPoseComponent(GetMesh());
        Component->bUseAttachParentBound = true;
    }
}
```

### Camera Interaction Considerations

When setting up modular components, we need to consider their interaction with the camera system:

1. **Visibility Culling**: Components inherit their parent's bounds:
   ```cpp
   Component->bUseAttachParentBound = true;
   ```
   This ensures proper visibility culling when the camera is close or far.

2. **Socket Placement**: Weapon sockets need to be visible in the camera view:
   ```cpp
   void ABlasterCharacter::CreateWeaponComponent(
       TObjectPtr<USkeletalMeshComponent>& Component, 
       const FString& Name,
       const FName& SocketName)
   {
       Component = CreateDefaultSubobject<USkeletalMeshComponent>(*Name);
       Component->SetupAttachment(GetMesh(), SocketName);
       Component->SetCollisionEnabled(ECollisionEnabled::NoCollision);
   }
   ```

## Integration and Testing

To test our complete setup:

1. Place the character in the level
2. Set Auto Possess Player to Player 0
3. Verify camera positioning and rotation
4. Check that modular components are visible
5. Test crouching to ensure camera stability
