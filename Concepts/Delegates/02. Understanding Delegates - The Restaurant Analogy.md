# Understanding Delegates: The Restaurant Analogy

Imagine you're at a busy restaurant on a Friday night. Here's how this relates to delegates in our multiplayer system:

## The Restaurant Scene

1. **You Arrive at the Restaurant (Initial Setup)**
   - You (Menu Class) want a table
   - The host (Multiplayer Subsystem) is managing tables
   - You're given a pager (Delegate) to notify you when ready

2. **The Waiting Process (Delegate in Action)**
   ```mermaid
   %%{init: {'theme':'dark', 'themeVariables': {'sequenceMessageLineColor': '#ffffff', 'actorTextColor': '#ffffff', 'actorBorder': '#ffffff'}}}%%
   sequenceDiagram
       participant Customer as You
       participant Host as Restaurant Host
       participant Table as Table System
       
       Customer->>Host: Request Table
       Host->>Customer: Give Pager
       Note over Customer,Host: You wait...
       Table->>Host: Table Ready
       Host->>Customer: Buzz Pager
       Customer->>Host: Return for Table
   ```

3. **What's Really Happening**
   - The pager (Delegate) is your connection to the host
   - You don't need to keep checking with the host
   - The host doesn't need to remember who you are
   - When your table is ready, you automatically get notified

This is exactly how our multiplayer system works:
- The Menu (you) wants to know when a session is ready
- The Subsystem (host) handles all the session management
- The Delegate (pager) automatically notifies when ready

The beauty is that just like you can do other things while waiting for your table, your game can continue running while waiting for the session to be created.
